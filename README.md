# Homework-3 : Password Generator

Created javascript code to run a password generator on previously supplied HTML file. The generator can range from 8 characters to 128 characters. The user has options to choose the amount of characters within the range as well as whether the password has uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters. 

If the user tries to generate a password of less than 8 or greater than 128 characters, an alert indicating that they must work within that range will appear on screen. The user must select atleast one of the character options. If the user tries to click "Generate Password" without selecting an option, a window alert will appear on the screen indicating that they must choose one. Each time the user selects one of the character options, they will be given an alert of the option that they chose.

Once the user has selected a character amount between 8 and 128 and has chosen atleast one of the character options, the user may press "Generate Password". A random password based on the user's prompts will generate in the text area. The user may add more character options or remove character options and select "Generate Password" to create a new password. If they would like to clear all choices and start from a the original screen, the user may select "Generate New".  

CSS styling changes include adding a different color scheme to the design and increasing the text size of the password generated to make it larger.

HTML changes include adding the character options as a form property, with an input type as a checkbox for easy user interaction. Removed unnecessary javascript file tagged in HTML file.
